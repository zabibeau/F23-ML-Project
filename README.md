# Problem
Political bias has become increasingly significant as politics around the world are becoming more and more polarized. In this project, we attempt to provide a solution to this problem by utilizing a variety of machine learning methods

# Description
In this repository we have the code that was used to run these machine learning algorithms. The datasets that were used can be found at the following links: [Twitter Data](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shanakiraj/twitterclassifier/input) [Article Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snapcrack/all-the-news).
We analyzed Twitter data by utilizing SVM, Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN), and Ordinary Random Forest (ORF) classifiers
For the analysis of article data, we used a Multiple Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).
